## Description

![Dark Tower board and pieces](/media/img/tabletop.jpg)

The 1981 Board Game _Dark Tower_ by Milton Bradley was an electronic fantasy that fueled my adventurous childhood. Apparently, I'm not alone, as there's quite a lot of nostalgia for this game, even though its beeps and whirrs are wincingly archaic compared to modern electronic games. If you want to know what the game was like, Orson Welles can say it best:

My old game, once loved and played weekly, is now dirty and with a partially collapsed box, having been living in my parents' basement for decades. I recovered it, which is great, but the electronics no longer function properly, which is sad. That's why I created this web app.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
